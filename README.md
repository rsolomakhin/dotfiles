> We deliberate not about ends but about means. For a doctor does not deliberate
> whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade, nor a
> statesman whether he shall produce law and order, nor does any one else
> deliberate about his end. They assume the end and consider how and by what
> means it is to be attained.

-- Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics
